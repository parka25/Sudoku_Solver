# Thanksgiving-CS-Project
Things that I did during CS during Thanksgiving 2022, Making a Sudoku Puzzle

I have created a Sudoku Puzzle Solver that automatically solves a given sudoku puzzle. The inital grid was generated through
the use of for loop and some cells,which generated a 9 arrray of [1,9] arrays. Within the interface, 
there are mainly three features: solve, clear, and generate random. The Sudoku code also checks for invalid inputs 
that does not fit into the rule of Sudoku. The clear button clears off all of rows and colummns from the overall grid.
a solve button implements the solve code (created in python) through server, and automatically fills all the cells 
that satisfies the sudoku code. Generate Random button brings in a random pregenerated grid and presents them.
